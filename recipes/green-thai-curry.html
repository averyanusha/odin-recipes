    <p>Thai Green Curry in 30 minutes made by freshening up store bought curry paste OR with a homemade green curry paste! Whichever way you go, the one essential step to make a really great green curry is to fry off the curry paste. </p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul class="ingridients">
      <li>4 - 6 tbsp Thai Green Curry Paste</li>
      <li>2 large garlic cloves</li>
      <li>2 tsp fresh ginger</li>
      <li>1 tbsp lemongrass paste</li>
      <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
      <li>400 g/14oz coconut milk</li>
      <li>1 - 3 tsp fish sauce</li>
      <li>1 - 3 tsp white sugar</li>
      <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
      <li>350 g/12 oz chicken thigh</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups snow peas</li>
      <li>6 kaffir lime leaves</li>
      <li>Juice of 1/2 lime</li>
    </ul>
    <ol class="steps">
      <li>
        <h3>STEP 1</h3>
        <p>Put 225g new potatoes, cut into chunks, in a pan of boiling water and cook for 5 minutes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>STEP 2</h3>
        <p>Add 100g trimmed and halved green beans and cook for a further 3 minutes, by which time both should be just tender but not too soft. Drain and put to one side.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>STEP 3</h3>
        <p>In a wok or large frying pan, heat 1 tbsp vegetable or sunflower oil until very hot, then drop in 1 chopped garlic clove and cook until golden, this should take only a few seconds. Donâ€™t let it go very dark or it will spoil the taste.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>STEP 4</h3>
        <p>Spoon in 1 rounded tbsp Thai green curry paste and stir it around for a few seconds to begin to cook the spices and release all the flavours.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>STEP 5</h3>
        <p>Next, pour in a 400ml can of coconut milk and let it come to a bubble.</p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <h3>STEP 6</h3>
        <p>Stir in 2 tsp Thai fish sauce and 1 tsp caster sugar, then 450g bite-size chicken pieces. Turn the heat down to a simmer and cook, covered, for about 8 minutes until the chicken is cooked.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>STEP 7</h3>
        <p>Tip in the potatoes and beans and let them warm through in the hot coconut milk, then add 2 finely shredded lime leaves (or 3 wide strips lime zest).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>STEP 8</h3>
        <p>Add a good handful basil leaves, but only leave them briefly on the heat or they will quickly lose their brightness.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>STEP 9</h3>
        <p>Scatter with lime to garnish and serve immediately with boiled rice.</p>
      </li>
